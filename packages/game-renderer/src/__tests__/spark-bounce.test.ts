/**
 * 火星落地有弹跳 — S12's 「火星飞溅用夸张粒子，落地有弹跳（比真实更脆）」, SPEC.md §16.
 *
 * What was missing was bigger than a flourish. Measured before this file, every spark the lighting
 * threw crossed the table's horizon at vy≈0.42 with 0.8–1.3 s of life left and died at y 1.00–1.30
 * of a stage that ends at 1.0: the scene draws a table and the sparks fell straight through it.
 *
 * The plane is `state.stage.layout.table.y` — where things *lie* (the rod, the pack and the tray are
 * all drawn on it), not `tableEdgeY`, which is the back edge of the same surface. The floor answers
 * sparks and nothing else: ash flakes are simulated by Game Core and settle flat on purpose, and a
 * plume that could not fall past a line would be a wall — which is what the last case proves.
