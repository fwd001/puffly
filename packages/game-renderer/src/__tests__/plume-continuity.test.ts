/**
 * The column has to be one line, not a string of beads — SPEC.md §15, §16.
 *
 * Found by rasterizing a frame rather than by a metric: once the smoke was given the drag air
 * actually exerts on it, it stopped travelling, and a stopped column is only as continuous as its
 * emission rate. The picture showed the smouldering thread as four or five separate dots with dark
 * air between them. Nothing about σx or elongation can see that — a row of dots is narrow.
 *
 * So this measures the one thing the eye reports: walking from the cherry to the top of the plume,
 * how much of the way is covered by some puff's own drawn disc, and how wide the widest stretch that
 * is not is. The second of those used to be a *count* of uncovered stretches, which turned out to be
 * a property of the ruler: a 24-slice walk over a thread 30 puffs tall calls one lost slice a hole,
 * while the same lost slice on a stub is a fifth of a puff. It reddened on a content number that
 * changes nothing about the air (a rod's burn length, which sets no emission rate), so the bound is
 * now stated in the puff's own radii instead.
