/**
 * The plume has three layers — SPEC.md S7 写实: 「烟羽分层：主体、边缘、卷曲三层独立速度与透明度」.
 *
 * #38 gave the smoke one shared flow field and it stopped being fog; #39 and #40 kept that body on
 * stage and made it one line. What was still missing was the deck's own word for what a plume *is*:
 * every particle in a breath was authored with the same brightness, the same buoyancy and the same
 * share of the room's eddies, so the column had no inside and no outside. One rope. S7 asks for a
 * body (主体), an edge that did not keep up (边缘) and curls that leave (卷曲).
 *
 * So this file measures the three populations the deck names, in the three quantities the deck names:
 * transparency, speed, and — for 卷曲 — how far out of the line they get. Bounds are the roster's own
 * readings from the `LAYER` lines this prints, with the slack the smallest sample needs (`cigar`
 * breathes 43 bodies, so 8 of them are curls).
 *
 * What the layering deliberately did *not* buy is a different cloud. Measured against the same table
 * collapsed to one layer: footprint 22.2% → 23.0% of the stage, the breath's lit width at 2 s 0.103 →
 * 0.092 of a stage height, and the peak against the room 5.58 → 5.45 (the floor plume-contrast.test.ts（2026-10-10 随 2D 光栅套件退役）
 * holds is 5). The 主体 keeps the authored buoyancy and carries 1.5× the authored alpha, so the halo is
 * added light rather than the body's light spent on it — and the two versions that got that wrong are
 * still in the numbers below: a flat-mean table (core 1.0 / edge 0.55 / curl 0.3) took that ratio to
 * 3.93, and equalising the alpha alone (speeds and couplings still layered) takes it to 4.60. Both are
 * 「烟看不清」, the one complaint this file may not reintroduce.
 *
 * Mutations, and what each one actually reddened — all measured, none assumed:
 * - alpha collapsed to one value → the eleven 透明度 cases **and** `plume-contrast`'s floor;
 * - buoyancy collapsed → 14: the eleven 速度 cases, 「the layers really part」, the co-existence case,
 *   and the footprint half of 「the outer layers are the ones that left the line」;
 * - coupling collapsed → exactly that last case's two swing lines. They are why this file asserts the
 *   coupling as a number at all: the footprint alone did not notice a coupling collapse — a body that
 *   rises less far simply samples less of the field — so three couplings would have been decorative;
 * - layers dealt in blocks (five core, three edge, two curl, in runs) → 「any seven consecutive
 *   births」, the co-existence case, and `plume-continuity`'s `long` row, while the proportions stay
 *   exactly right, which is why the dealing and the share are two separate cases;
 * - material bursts given layers → 「an event has no halo」 and `spark-bounce`'s hop;
 * - the draught applied to every layer, or to none → the one draught case in each direction;
 * - the resize copy dropping `layer`, or the frame dropping `ventDraught` → the two wiring cases.
