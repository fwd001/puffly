/**
 * The stage: how a canvas becomes a place to put things — SPEC.md §55, §66.
 *
 * Two ideas live here and nowhere else:
 *
 *  1. `stageBoxFor` — the rectangle inside a canvas that props may occupy. It keeps a
 *     sane aspect (a phone fills the screen, an ultrawide gets a centred strip) and is
 *     shared by the renderer and the shell, so hit-testing and drawing can never disagree
 *     about where "the middle" is.
 *  2. `layoutFor` — where the pack, lighter, tray and held rod sit *for that shape*.
 *     A landscape phone and a portrait phone have completely different empty space, and
 *     one normalised table cannot serve both: that is what made the landscape layout look
 *     like a pebble in a shoebox.
 *
 * Positions are normalised to the stage box (0..1 on both axes). Because the box aspect
 * varies, distances in that space are anisotropic, so `stageDistance` carries the aspect
 * into every hit test instead of pretending x and y are the same size.
