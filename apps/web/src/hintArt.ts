 * nothing and the strip disappeared, so the tier that most needs a picture was the one holding none.
 * Only one gesture has a picture the deck actually names, and it is the hold: the paper collapsing is
 * what the deck tells the player to watch for (S7's silent chain, S14's gesture table, S1's mock).
