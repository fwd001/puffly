/**
 * Reading the shell's own source, for the guards that have no other way to reach a wiring.

 * exists, it is in the branch that means it, and it happens once — and nothing more: a wrong
 * argument, a thrown exception, or a value that never reaches the engine still pass here. Every file
 * that uses this says so in its own header rather than implying a stronger claim.
