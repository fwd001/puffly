/**
 * S6's 写实度 row, checked as a control and as a wiring.
 *
 * Structural on purpose, the way `reverb-row.test.ts` reads the sheet: apps/web has no component
 * harness, so `sourceProbe`'s rule applies — these checks buy "the call exists, in the branch that
 * means it, and once", and nothing more. What the dial *does* to the picture is judged in
 * `packages/game-renderer/src/__tests__/realism.test.ts`, and what it must never do to the burn is
 * judged there too; this file is about the row being a row and about the shell handing the number to
 * the renderer at all.
 *
 * The two ways a settings row rots are specific: a control that writes a different setting than the
 * one it names, and a control whose value never leaves the sheet.
