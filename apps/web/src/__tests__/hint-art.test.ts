/**
 * S15's last half: 提示条换成纸面塌陷示意图 — the picture the strip is supposed to carry once the tier
 * has run out of words.
 *
 * The deck states the order at the top of that same page (目标语言 → 英文 → 纯图标), and the strip obeyed
 * it only as far as "nothing": with no word to print it disappeared, so 纯图标 — the tier that needs a
 * picture most — was the one left with none. What is pinned here is that the picture exists, that it is
 * the *same* shape the rod is drawn with rather than a second authoring of it, and that a player who
 * turned hint words off still gets nothing.
