/**
 * The ash column and the weather are on two different clocks — SPEC.md §18, §22.
 *
 * A gust knocks the ash off (§22: the room does things that are not asked for), and the column grows
 * as the cherry eats the rod (§18). The first is counted in wall minutes, the second in millimetres
 * of tobacco, so the ratio between them is set by how fast the rod burns — and the deck's own minute
 * figures moved that ratio out of balance. Four of the eleven rods then met so much weather per
 * millimetre of ash that the column was knocked off sooner than it could regrow, and `ash.ready` —
 * the beat the deck calls 磕灰, one of the six the whole loop is made of — never arrived at all:
 * measured on an unattended burn, `night` `long` `cigarillo` and `cigar` each ran past their own full
 * burn length with `ready` never once true.
 *
 * The rule that fixes it is not a threshold nobody justified: a gust may take a column whenever the
 * rod still has another one left in it, and not when it does not. Nothing new is invented — the two
 * quantities are the same ones the ash system already uses — and 灰量, 时长 and 口数 are untouched,
 * so this is not a burn-rate retune wearing a disguise.
